# My answers for EOPL exercises

## Base/libs
 This is all the original code from the books.

## Ch
 The code for almost all exercises, except some trivial or hard problems.
 (run-all) (check-all) will run all the testcases.

 Before chapter8, I put all the code for a interpreter in a signal file.
 Begin chapter 8, I put base code in the base dir of each chapter, and load it when necesarry.

## Note
 The code tested on Chicken Scheme,
 assumed to be runnable for most other Scheme implementation.
