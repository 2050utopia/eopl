# My answers for EOPL

## Base/libs
 This is all the original code from the books.
 I have some modification on utilities.

## Ch*
 My answer code for almost all exercises, except some trivial or hard problems.
 Usually the function (run-all) and (check-all) will run all the testcases.

 Before chapter 8, I put all the code for a interpreter in a signal file.
 Begin with chapter 8, I put base code in the base directory of each chapter, and load it when necesarry.

## Note
 The code tested on Chicken Scheme,
 and assumed to be runnable for most other Scheme implementation.

## Contribution
