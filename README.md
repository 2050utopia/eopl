## My answers for EOPL3

### Base/libs

This is all the original code from the book. I have some modification on utilities.

### Ch

My answer code for the exercises, NOT all problem are solved, so any complement is welcome.

Usually the function all (run-all) and (check-all) will run all the test-cases.

Before chapter 8, I put all the code for an interpreter in signal file.

Begin with chapter 8, I put base code in the base directory of each chapter, and load it when necessary.

### Note
The code are tested on Chicken Scheme with chicken-slime in Emacs,
and assumed to be runnable for most other Scheme implementation.
